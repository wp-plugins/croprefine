Giving you greater control over how each of your media item sizes are cropped.

== Description ==

Extends the WordPress Media Library to allow individual control over each media item size's crop.


**For those particular about their imagery...**

WordPress's Media Library already gives authors strong, intuitive organization over their web site's images. But some users are a little more particular than others over the individual crop sizes of each media item. CropRefine is for the those keen-eyed, visual types who want something fast and fastidious. 

* CropRefine provides quick-links from the Media Library to refine each item.
* A full catalog of existing crops and sizes are made available for refinement.
* If you prefer a different/better thumbnail but want to leave the other sizes untouched, CropRefine gives you that level of granularity over your imagery.
* Packaged with cropper.js, adjusting a crop is a smooth, draggable, precise refinement experience.
* Iterative backups are stored along side each adjustment, so nothing is ever lost&mdash;only gained!
* If a re-crop just won't achieve the results you're after, a quick-upload tool is also offered for each media item size, so that you can replace that (and only that) size.
* No additional database is needed, no exhaustive setup process, no hidden license costs.

== Installation ==

1. Install CropRefine either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory).
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Visit your Media Library to find the new 'Refine' option, below each media item.
1. Choose Re-Crop or Upload next to the size you wish to adjust, and the rest is handled for you.
